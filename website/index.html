			<h3>About Vector</h3>
			<p>Vector is a puzzle platformer game where you must figure out the correct sequence in order to make it to the next level. The objective of the game is to solve the puzzles and to have fun doing it. For this reason, we had to find the right balance of difficulty and easiness. If the puzzles are too easy they are not entertaining, but if the puzzles are too difficult, they become frustrating. We strive for that just-challenging-enough medium for Vector.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Design Principles</h3>
			<ul class="square">
				<li>For the beginning levels, we have added text that will give hints on how to approach the level.</li>
				<li>For movement, we use both the ‘W’’A’’S’’D’ keys and the arrow keys, so that people with lots of experience with computer games and an nonnative users can both intuitively use the game. </li>
				<li>To help the user understand that they can move their spite without having to learn through trial and error, we have added text to the top left part of the screen that is a short description of the movement keys.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Features</h3>
			<ul class="square">
				<li>The game is built on HTML5 so it is playable through any modern browser.</li>
				<li>It also makes it easily playable on a mobile device.</li>
				<li>Gravity changing is done by mouse or touch input for usability.</li>

			<p>Draw arrow using your mouse to change the gravity. In this case we are changing the gravity to the right</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/2.png"/>
			<p>After changing the gravity you need to wait for a few seconds to be able to change the gravity again</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/3.png"/>
			<p>The goal is to get to the door by changing gravity and without touching or falling into electric wall</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/4.png"/>
			<p>Falling into the electric wall or touching it will kill the player</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/5.png"/>
			<p>In advanced levels like the one above, crates are there to help the player.</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/6.png"/>
			<p>A crate can be used a barrier between the sprite and an electrocution rail. </p>
